# Introduction

## Context

## Research Question & Hypothesis

**Research question:** Do red-footed boobies hunt near pods of dolphins?

**Hypothesis:** Since hunting pods of spotted dolphins drive pelagic prey toward the ocean surface, if red-footed boobies associate with spotted dolphins for foraging, then red-footed boobies will be in the foraging state when near dolphin pods.

## The Movement Ecology Scientific Model & the Statistical Model

-   Proximity to a pod of dolphins is an external state that influences the bird's decision of how they should move â€” whether they should stay in their current state or switch.
    -   The red-footed booby isn't necessarily seeing the pod of dolphins, rather picking up on the effects of pelagic predators (like increased prey fish at the water surface).
-   By observing the movement path (simulated tracks), it is possible to reconstruct the bird's motion capacity; determining whether they were in the "forage" or "transit" state.
-   In combination with the external state (pod proximity map), it is possible to understand how my chosen environmental covariate affects the red-footed booby's movement path using hidden state decoding/transition rate probabilites.

# Methods

## Data Creation

I started with a 10 inch by 5 inch canvas in google drawings.

I created a "map" ([@fig-colorful-map]) of the Oahu-Kauai channel use outlines of the islands that contain no red. That way, I was able use the islands to create a map and tracks (i.e., have a starting point that's on land, flying only at sea) without affecting the environmental covariate data is measured using amount of red ([@fig-pod-map]).

![My map of the Oahu-Kauai Channel](Recolored_map.png){#fig-colorful-map}

Then, I made concentric shapes with 50, 100, 150, 200, and finally the maximum 255 red values. The 255 red shapes represent dolphin pods, with concentric shape indicating proximity to the pods. I scattered a few of these "pods" with different sizes and dimensions throughout my map.

```{r}
#| label: load-map
#| warning: false 

map <- rast("Recolored_map.tiff")
ext(map) <- ext(0,10,0,5) 
crs(map) <- "epsg:4326"
map <- flip(map, direction = "vertical")

pods <- map[[1]]

plot(map)

```

```{r}
#| label: fig-pod-map
#| fig-cap: "Map of proximity to dolphin pods" 
#| echo: false

plot(pods)
```

Similarly, I also customized the blue values of the concentric circles (20, 40, 60, 80, 100) to make the track map ([@fig-load-tracks]).

Next, on a copy of this map, I drew out tracks using the line tool. Finally, I estimated the points where my track lines meet to the nearest 0.05 inch. In google drawings, 0 is at the top left of the page instead of the bottom, so I had to flip all of my values by subtracting the "reverse y" from 5 to get final y values.

```{r}
#| label: fig-load-tracks
#| fig-cap: "Map of the channel with my simulated tracks"
#| warning: false 

track_df <- read_csv("Red_Booby_Tracks.csv") # Load the fake tracks into a dataframe for HMM

# Make the tracks into a vector using the coordinate system from the environmental data.  
track_sp <- vect(track_df,
                 geom = c("x", "y"),
                 crs = crs(pods))
track_lines <- as.lines(track_sp) # Connect the points for visualization

# Visualize
ggplot() +
  geom_spatraster(data = map[[3]]) +
  scale_fill_grass_c(palette = "bcyr") +
  geom_spatvector(data = track_lines, col = "black", linewidth = 0.75) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
  
```

## Model Construction

### Model Justification

Why HMM works better than decision trees/random forests:

Random forests are a type of supervised learning, meaning they are trained to differentiate between classes using ***labelled*** data sets.

To label certain parts of the red-footed booby track data as "forage" and others as "transit", tangible (e.g., visual) observations of the bird diving for prey (or observations of some other behavior that would allow for definitive state classification) are needed. Unambiguous observations of foraging behavior would allow for the direct association of movement path metrics and state labels. However, labeling data is not available for this data set.

Instead, transit and forage are ***hidden*** states. A model that can classify states without any labelled training data using only estimated parameter is needed to classify this data. The model must immediately figure out aspects of that data that the researchers do not know, the hidden states. So, for this data a ***Hidden*** Markov Model is the best fit.

### Model fitting

```{r}
#| label: prepare-data

# Prepare the data for model fitting - add step length and turning angle columns
track_prepped <- prepData(track_df, coordNames = c("x", "y"))

```

```{r}
#| label: viz-metrics
#| fig-cap: 
#| - "Step length distribution"
#| - "Turning angle distribution"
#| warning: false
#| echo: false

# Visualize distribution of step lengths
ggplot(track_prepped, aes(step)) +
  geom_histogram()

# Visualize distribution of turning angles
ggplot(track_prepped, aes(angle)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

| Parameter           | Forage | Transit |
|---------------------|--------|---------|
| Step mean           | 35     | 15      |
| Step deviation      | 10     | 5       |
| Angle mean          | 0      | 0       |
| Angle concentration | 1      | 2       |

# Results

State 1 corresponds to transit. State 2 corresponds to foraging.

```{r}
#| label: fig-fit-hmm
#| fig-cap: 
#| - "Emmision distribution (step length), hidden state indicated by color"
#| - "Emmision distribution (turning angle), hidden state indicated by color"
#| - "Transition rate probabilities (transition rate 'matrix')"
#| - "Data: tracks color-coded by hidden state"

# First, extract the pod proximity at the track locations and attach the proximity data to the track data. 
track_pods <- terra::extract(pods, track_sp)
track_prepped$pods <- track_pods[,2]

# Fit 2-state hidden markov model, incorporating the pod proximity
track_hmm <- fitHMM(track_prepped,
                    nbState = 2,
                    formula = ~ pods,
                    stepPar0 = c(35, 15, 10, 5),
                    anglePar0 = c(0, 0, 1, 2))

plot(track_hmm, ask = FALSE)
```

# Discussion

Does the figure support or contradict my hypothesis?

M.3: Fit models to data and interpret the results

The HMM output shows that red-footed boobies forage more near dolphin pods, supporting the hypothesis that they feed in association with spotted dolphins. As seen in [@fig-fit-hmm-3], the bird's probability of staying in the transit state or switching into it plummets as it get close to a dolphin pod. On the other hand, when the bird is near a dolphin pod, it has a very high probability of being in the foraging state (i.e., switching into or staying into it).

Additionally, comparing [@fig-fit-hmm-4] and [@fig-load-tracks] indicates that two of the bird's three foraging periods happen in close proximity to a dolphin pod.
